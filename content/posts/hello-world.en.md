## Welcome!

This is my personal blog built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The blog uses the following tech stack:

- **Hugo** - A fast static site generator
- **GitHub Pages** - Free static website hosting
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated build and deployment

## Why Hugo?

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go, with the following advantages:

1. Extremely fast build speed
2. Rich theme ecosystem
3. Great Markdown writing experience
4. Simple deployment

## What's Next

I'll be sharing technical articles, learning notes, and personal thoughts here. Stay tuned!

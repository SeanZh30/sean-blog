## Preface

Applying for a PhD is probably one of the most important decisions I've made so far. This path is incredibly challenging — especially in AI/ML where competition is fiercer than ever. I thought about giving up many times. But like trading — markets have drawdowns, and the key is whether you have the conviction to hold your position. Fortunately, I met many wonderful mentors and friends who helped me push through. I'm documenting this to hopefully help future PhD applicants.

This is an entirely subjective account. Everyone's background and experience differ, so take everything as a reference only.

## Helpful Resources

I was a complete novice when I started. After consulting seniors and reading experience posts, I gradually understood the workflow. Some posts that helped me a lot:

- **[2021 Fall Application Memoir by Ziyi Wu](https://fffffall.com/)** — Very detailed, with all application materials on GitHub.
- **[Application Memoir by Jiayi Weng](https://trinkle23897.github.io/posts/application)** — Systematically covers required materials; the SOP writing section is excellent.
- **[A Regular Student's PhD Application Journey](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/457967587)** — Concise but comprehensive.

Seniors in your research area are especially valuable — they know which professors moved where, which departments are hiring APs. Talk to as many people as you can.

## Preparation

### Conviction

A PhD is a five-year commitment. You'll face all kinds of setbacks. Many PhDs I know have questioned or regretted their choice at some point.

I've always believed in one principle: **constantly raise your floor**. Whether it's research, coding, or playing basketball — progress isn't about occasional highlights, it's about how stable you are at your worst. A PhD is the same — you won't have breakthroughs every day, not every experiment will work, but you can ensure that even at your lowest, you're still making steady progress. This mindset carried me through many moments of wanting to quit.

It's like racing — winning isn't about posting the fastest single lap, it's about keeping every lap consistent and making fewer mistakes. Five years of PhD is an endurance race. You don't need to be the fastest every lap, but you need to stay on the track.

**What does a PhD mean? Why do you want one?** In my view, there's only one core reason to pursue a PhD — you genuinely want to do research, to enjoy the process of expanding the boundaries of knowledge, even when you hit walls. Only by thinking this through before applying will you be mentally prepared for the challenges ahead.

### Agencies / Consultants

I asked many seniors if they used agencies. The vast majority said no. The process is hard — joining labs, publishing papers, getting recommendation letters, preparing CVs and SOPs, selecting schools, cold emailing, interviewing. But fundamentally, all of this depends on yourself.

I went fully DIY, but had PhD seniors review all my materials multiple times. Polish it yourself, read template SOPs, and iterate. Like coding — someone else's code review always catches more bugs than your own debugging.

## The Application

I only applied to North American schools. Most require an SOP, CV, and three recommendation letters. Some require a Personal Statement. Check TOEFL/GRE requirements early — some schools have strict speaking score thresholds even for US undergrads (e.g., UIUC).

### Timeline

| Action | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| Join a lab | ASAP — affects recommendation letters and publications |
| TOEFL/GRE | Ideally done by summer; November is too busy |
| School selection & cold emailing | Start in summer; ask target professors if recruiting |
| CV | Find a LaTeX template, spend a couple days, refine over time |
| SOP | Only 2 pages but hard to write well — start in September |
| Request rec letters | Some professors only write for limited students — ask in October |
| Submit applications | Most NA deadlines are Dec 15 — plan ahead |
| Personal website | Optional but most CS PhDs have one — recommended |
| Interview prep | Start after submitting — prepare slides, practice with peers |

### Getting Into a Lab

If you're studying abroad, seize every opportunity to join a lab. Early lab experience = more time for research and discovering your true interests. Often, **recommendation letters and publications alone determine where you can go**. For PhD applications, coursework matters less. If stretched thin, strategically take lighter courses (but GPA still matters — between two otherwise equal candidates, the professor likely picks the higher GPA).

Summer research is also crucial. Start cold emailing for summer positions in March. Many top professors prefer admitting students they've already worked with — a summer position could lead to a return offer.

## How to Select Schools

School selection is the most strategic part of the application. It's not simply "the higher the ranking, the better" — you need to consider research fit, advisor style, admission system, location, and even funding.

### Rankings Are Just a Starting Point

Useful ranking resources:

- [Computer Science Open Data](https://drafty.cs.brown.edu/csopendata/) — Considers faculty placement rate, best paper count, and salary.
- [csrankings](https://csrankings.org/) — Based on publication counts. Somewhat lagging but gives a general picture.
- [airankings](https://airankings.org/) — Similar to csrankings, AI-focused.

However, **high overall ranking doesn't mean your specific area is strong there**. A top-ranked school might only have one or two professors in your niche. Conversely, a mid-ranked school might have an incredibly strong group in your subfield. Always look at specific faculty and their recent research output.

### Understand Admission Systems

- **Strong committee**: The committee screens candidates; individual professors can't decide alone (e.g., the "Big Four").
- **Mixed**: Must pass committee first, then professors pick from the pool.
- **Strong professor**: The professor's decision is what matters — application materials and even deadlines are secondary.

**Schools with strong professor systems include:** USC, Caltech, UCLA, RPI, Georgia Tech, JHU, CU Boulder, NEU, UCSB, UCD, UCI, UCSC, UMass Amherst, CMU ECE, UIUC ECE + CS, UVA, Rutgers, PSU, UTD, UCF, NYU, UMN, Syracuse, GWU, CWRU, UNC, UMich, Brandeis.

For professor-driven schools, cold emailing is critical — if the professor wants you, the rest is a formality.

### My School Selection Strategy

My approach followed this framework:

1. **Define research keywords** — Clarify what you want to do, list 3-5 core keywords.
2. **Find faculty** — Use csrankings, Google Scholar, and reverse-search top conference papers for active professors. Focus on their last 2-3 years of papers, not just what's listed on their homepage.
3. **Tier your list** — Categorize schools into reach, match, and safety. Don't go all-in on top schools or all safeties. My ratio was roughly 3:5:2.
4. **Check actual availability** — Is the target professor recruiting? (Twitter, personal website, forums). Check their group size and student placement. A professor with 8 existing PhDs probably isn't recruiting this year.
5. **Consider "soft factors"** — Location (affects internship access), cost of living, stipend level, internship policies. These become very real when choosing between offers.

### Don't Only Chase Top Schools

A common mistake is only applying to Top 10 programs. But:

- Many excellent APs are at schools ranked 20-50. They're just starting, have ample funding, and invest more in students.
- A perfect-fit advisor at a Top 30 school is likely better for you than a marginal-fit professor at a Top 5.
- **The advisor matters most**, not the school's prestige. Your papers carry your name and your advisor's, not the school's.

## Cold Emailing

Writing cold emails is an art — professors may receive dozens or hundreds daily. How do you stand out in 200-300 words? My approach: **lead with your most impressive results in the first paragraph** to hook them, then elaborate. Like a trading pitch — your opening line determines whether they keep reading.

A professor's cold email guidelines:

> - Title: "Prospective PhD Student: YourName - YourAffiliation"
> - Briefly introduce yourself: education, research experience, programming skills
> - Explain your motivations and expectations; include CV as PDF
> - Describe the research problem you're interested in, current SOTA, and why you can improve on it

Useful recruiting info:
- [CS/HCI Research Hub](https://www.cs-phd-recruiting.com/) — Aggregates professor recruiting posts from Twitter
- [1point3acres Recruiting Forum](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/forum-82-1.html) — Many APs post here

## CV / SOP

Use a **LaTeX template** for your CV — Word gets messy, LaTeX stays clean. No age or photos. Highlight strengths: long publication list, awards in prominent positions.

For the SOP: **be as clear and concrete as possible**. Structure: (very concretely) what research I want to do → why → why my background makes me well-equipped. Keep it clean and logical — no flowery writing.

Research interests must be specific. "My research interests are AI, machine learning" is too vague. Write precisely: **"use xxx, yyy, zzz perspective to solve aaa problem in bbb."** If it's specific and no professor is interested, it just means the school isn't a fit — not a reflection of your ability.

[cs-sop.org](https://cs-sop.org) has collected SOPs from past CS PhD applicants.

For polishing, I had seniors review logic, then used the school's writing center for grammar. Some recommend [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) as well.

## Interviews

Some committee-only schools skip interviews, but most do them from late December through mid-February.

I was very nervous at first. But professors aren't trying to trip you up — they just want to chat and get to know you. Like meeting new teammates on a basketball court — everyone's evaluating whether they'd play well together, not taking an exam. So relax. **This is a mutual selection process.**

Some students want frequent meetings to stay on track — they might prefer APs. Others want full autonomy — they might prefer established professors. Know what you need.

Interesting interview questions I encountered:

- What works in your field use similar methods to yours? Similarities and differences?
- Describe a failed project — why it failed, what you'd do differently.
- Here are two papers — summarize contributions and brainstorm follow-up work.
- Explain the weaknesses of a data mining method and propose an improvement on the spot.

Overall, interviews are relaxed. If you don't know something, just say so. The Q&A at the end is valuable — see [The Definitive PhD Advisor Guide](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Get-Advisor.pdf) for sample questions.

## Waiting for Results

Waiting is agonizing, but there's nothing left to do. Earliest results come mid-January, most in February, nearly all by late March (deadline to decide is April 15). Track offers on [GradCafe](https://www.thegradcafe.com/) and [1point3acres](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/forum-82-1.html).

After receiving offers, [Questions to Ask a Prospective Ph.D. Advisor on Visit Day](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/03/02/questions-to-ask-a-prospective-ph-d-advisor-on-visit-day-with-answers/) covers what to ask before accepting.

My key questions:

- What's the lab culture like?
- Collaboration style — hands-on, pushy, or flexible? Can you discuss and revise papers together?
- Graduation requirements
- Can I transfer credits?
- Is funding sufficient? Will I need to TA?
- Living conditions and stipend
- Where have past students ended up?
- Summer internship policies — any restrictions?
- Are projects advisor-assigned or self-directed?
- Does the advisor plan to move schools or go to industry?

## Final Thoughts

The application process is exhausting, but it's also an invaluable journey of self-discovery. Writing your SOP forces you to re-examine why you want to do research. Selecting schools clarifies what kind of life you want. Interviewing teaches you how to articulate your ideas.

As I've always believed — **what matters isn't where you stand right now, but that your floor keeps rising**. Every SOP revision, every cold email, every interview pushes your baseline higher. When you look back after the process, you'll realize you've grown far beyond where you started.

Best of luck to everyone applying for a PhD!

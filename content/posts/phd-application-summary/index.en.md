## Preface

Deciding to pursue a PhD is one of the biggest decisions in life. This path is incredibly challenging — especially in Computer Vision, where competition is fierce. I thought about giving up many times, but I was fortunate to have wonderful mentors and friends who helped me push through. I'm writing this to document my experience and hopefully help future PhD applicants.

Special thanks to all the friends and seniors who gave me application advice, helped me select schools, reviewed my writing materials, and kept me sane throughout the process. I truly couldn't have made it without you all.

## Helpful Resources

I was a complete novice when I started the application process. After consulting with seniors and reading through experience posts, I gradually understood the overall workflow. Here are some posts that helped me a lot:

- **[2021 Fall Application Memoir by Ziyi Wu](https://fffffall.com/)** — Very detailed, with all application materials uploaded to GitHub. Highly valuable as a reference.
- **[Application Memoir by Jiayi Weng](https://trinkle23897.github.io/posts/application)** — Systematically introduces the materials needed for applications. The section on SOP writing is particularly well-summarized.
- **[A Regular Student's PhD Application Journey](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/457967587)** — Concise but comprehensive. A quick way to understand the full picture.

Zhihu (a Chinese Q&A platform) also has many experience posts. Seniors in your research area are especially valuable sources — they're more attuned to industry trends, like which professors have moved schools or which departments are hiring new APs. Talk to as many people as you can.

## Preparation

### Conviction

A PhD is a five-year commitment. During this time, you'll face all kinds of setbacks. Many PhDs I know have questioned or even regretted their choice at some point. I've also seen PhDs who had falling-outs with their advisors and had to quit.

**The only reason to pursue a PhD should be passion** — a genuine love for research, for doing interesting things, for the process of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, even when you hit walls. A PhD means potentially working around the clock for five years. While others are partying, you're running experiments. While others are watching shows, you're reading papers. No fixed work hours also means no clear boundary between work and rest.

**What does a PhD mean? Why do you want one?** You must think these two questions through before applying. Only then will you be mentally prepared for the challenges ahead.

### Agencies / Consultants

I asked many seniors whether they used application agencies. The vast majority said no. The application process is difficult — getting into labs, publishing papers, getting recommendation letters, preparing CVs and SOPs, selecting schools and professors, cold emailing, interviewing. But all of this fundamentally depends on yourself. What agencies can help with is limited to polishing writing, managing timelines, and filling out applications. My advice: **go fully DIY, but have PhD seniors review all your materials multiple times.**

## The Application

I only applied to North American schools. Most require an SOP, CV, and three recommendation letters. Some also require a Personal Statement. For TOEFL/GRE, some schools have strict speaking score requirements that even US undergrads can't waive (e.g., UIUC). Check language requirements early. If applying to Hong Kong or Europe, you'll also need a research proposal.

### Timeline

| Action | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| Join a lab | As early as possible — this affects recommendation letters and publications |
| TOEFL/GRE | Ideally done by summer; November is too hectic |
| School selection & cold emailing | Start in summer; ask target professors if they're recruiting before applying |
| CV | Find a nice template, spend a day or two, refine details over time |
| SOP | Only 2 pages, but hard to write well — start in September |
| Request recommendation letters | Some professors only write for a limited number of students — ask in October |
| Submit applications | Most North American deadlines are Dec 15 — plan ahead and check each school's requirements |
| Personal website | Optional but most CS PhDs have one — recommended |
| Interview prep | Start after submitting — prepare slides about your research, practice with peers |

### Getting Into a Lab

If you're already studying abroad for undergrad or master's, seize every opportunity to join a lab. Early lab experience gives you more time for research and helps you discover your true interests. Often, **recommendation letters and publications alone determine where a student can go**. For PhD applications, coursework matters less. If you're stretched thin, strategically take easier courses (this doesn't mean GPA doesn't matter — between two otherwise equal candidates, the professor will likely choose the one with the higher GPA).

Summer research is also crucial. You can apply to labs at other schools starting in March. Many top professors prefer admitting students they've already worked with — so a summer position could lead directly to a return offer.

### School Selection & Cold Emailing

For CS rankings, check out [Computer Science Open Data](https://drafty.cs.brown.edu/csopendata/) (considers faculty placement rate, best paper count, and salary) and [csrankings](https://csrankings.org/) (based on publication counts). Also see [airankings](https://airankings.org/).

Different schools have different admission systems:

- **Strong committee**: The committee screens candidates; individual professors can't decide admissions alone (e.g., the "Big Four").
- **Mixed**: Candidates must pass the committee first, then professors pick from the pool.
- **Strong professor**: The professor makes the call — application materials and even deadlines matter less.

**Schools with strong professor systems include:** USC, Caltech, UCLA, RPI, Georgia Tech, JHU, CU Boulder, NEU, UCSB, UCD, UCI, UCSC, UMass Amherst, CMU ECE, UIUC ECE + CS, UVA, Rutgers, PSU, UTD, UCF, NYU, UMN, Syracuse, GWU, CWRU, UNC, UMich, Brandeis.

Cold emails are an art — professors may receive dozens or hundreds daily. How do you grab their attention in 200-300 words? My approach: **lead with your most impressive results in the first paragraph** to hook them, then elaborate on your experience.

Here's what one professor requested in cold emails:

> - Title: "Prospective PhD Student: YourName - YourAffiliation"
> - Briefly introduce yourself: education, research experience, programming skills
> - Explain your motivations and expectations of working with them; include your CV as PDF
> - Describe the research problem you're interested in, current state-of-the-art solutions, and why you think you can improve on them

### CV / SOP

Use a **LaTeX template** for your CV — Word tends to get messy. Don't include age or photos. Highlight your strengths: long publication list, awards in prominent positions.

For the SOP, my advice: **be as clear and concrete as possible**. Structure it as: (very concretely) what research I want to do → why I want to do it → why my background makes me well-equipped for it. Keep it clean and logical — no flowery writing.

For research interests, be specific. Don't write "my research interests are AI, machine learning..." Instead: **"use xxx, yyy, zzz perspective to solve aaa problem in bbb."** If no professor at that school is interested, it just means the school isn't a fit — it's not about your ability. Look at faculty candidates' research statements in your target area for reference.

[cs-sop.org](https://cs-sop.org) has collected SOPs from past CS PhD applicants.

For polishing, I had seniors review the logic and used the school's writing center for grammar. Some recommend [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) as well.

### Interviews

Some committee-only schools skip interviews and send offers directly, but most schools do interview. Interview season is late December through mid-February.

I was very nervous at first, afraid of being stumped by questions. But I soon realized **professors aren't trying to trip you up** — they just want to chat, learn about your research interests, and get to know you. So relax. **This is a mutual selection process.** While the professor evaluates you, you should also be evaluating whether their lab is right for you.

Some students prefer frequent meetings with their advisor to stay motivated — they might prefer APs. Others want full autonomy over their projects — they might prefer established professors who are less hands-on. Know what you want.

Interesting interview questions I encountered:

- What works in your field use methods similar to yours? What are the similarities and differences?
- Describe a failed project — why did it fail, and what would you do differently?
- Here are two papers — summarize the contributions and think about potential follow-up work.
- Explain the weaknesses of a specific data mining method, and propose an improvement on the spot.

Overall, interviews are relaxed and professors are friendly. If you don't know something, just say so — they'll understand.

Don't waste the Q&A portion at the end. [The Definitive 'what do I ask/look for' in a PhD Advisor Guide](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Get-Advisor.pdf) has great sample questions.

### Waiting for Results

Waiting is agonizing, but there's nothing left to do. The earliest results may come in mid-January; most schools announce in February. By late March, nearly all results are out — students need to decide by April 15. [GradCafe](https://www.thegradcafe.com/) and [1point3acres](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/forum-82-1.html) are good places to track offer releases.

After receiving offers, it's decision time. [Questions to Ask a Prospective Ph.D. Advisor on Visit Day](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/03/02/questions-to-ask-a-prospective-ph-d-advisor-on-visit-day-with-answers/) covers what to ask before accepting.

Questions I cared about:

- What's the lab culture like?
- What's the collaboration style with the advisor — are they hands-on, pushy, or flexible? Can you discuss and revise papers together?
- Graduation requirements
- Can I transfer credits?
- Is the advisor's funding sufficient? Will I need to TA?
- Living conditions
- Where have past students ended up?
- Can I do summer internships? Any restrictions (topic or type)?
- Are projects assigned by the advisor or self-directed?
- Does the advisor plan to move schools or go to industry?
